# Conflict Rule 2
## Adhere to the new life rule.

[color=yellow][bold]After death, your memory and behavior depend on how you return:[/bold][/color]
- [color=green][bold]Revival (defib, medical intervention):[/bold][/color] You regain full memory of your previous life, but details about who killed you, how, and with what should remain vague or obscure. You may remember some general aspects, but not specific names, vessels, or clear identifying information.
- [color=yellow][bold]Cloned (medical cloner):[/bold][/color] Forget the last 15 minutes before death (events, engagement, people involved). Do not act on information from that period.
- [color=red][bold]Respawn:[/bold][/color] Forget the last 30 minutes before death. Do not seek revenge or act on information related to your death or the last 30 minutes. You may remember earlier events, but may not return for your previous lifeâ€™s items or the location of your death during an ongoing situation.
-- [color=yellow][bold]You may not respawn as the same character on an opposing faction.[/bold][/color]

[italic][color=green]The New Life Rule helps maintain fairness and immersion by preventing players from immediately rejoining conflicts or recovering lost gear after death.[/color][/italic]
