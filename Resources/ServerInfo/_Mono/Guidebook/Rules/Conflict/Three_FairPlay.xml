# Conflict Rule 3
## Engage in fair play when making demands.

- Players must be given a reasonable time ([color=yellow][bold]at least 20 seconds[/bold][/color]) to react to demands before capture, serious injury, or death is inflicted.
- All demands must be made in [color=yellow]English[/color] so they are clearly understood by all parties.
- Use [color=green]roleplay[/color] and [color=green]escalation[/color]; avoid making impossible or unclear demands.

[italic][color=green]Fair play ensures everyone has a chance to respond and participate in the story, rather than being caught off guard or unable to comply.[/color][/italic]
