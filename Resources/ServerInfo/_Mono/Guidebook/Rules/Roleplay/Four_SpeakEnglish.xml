# Roleplay Rule 4
## Speak English exclusively in out-of-character situations.

- [color=red][bold]All out-of-character (OOC) communication must be in English.[/bold][/color]
- This includes [color=yellow]staff interventions[/color], [color=yellow]ahelp[/color], [color=yellow]OOC chat[/color], and any other non-roleplay context.
- You may communicate in other languages in-character (IC), as part of roleplay, but must switch to [color=yellow]English[/color] for OOC matters.

[italic][color=green]This ensures that staff and all players can understand important communications and maintain a fair environment.[/color][/italic]
