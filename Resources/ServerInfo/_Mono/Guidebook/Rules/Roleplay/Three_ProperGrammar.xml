# Roleplay Rule 3
## Type with proper grammar in in-character text chat.

- Use correct [color=yellow]capitalization[/color], [color=yellow]punctuation[/color], and [color=yellow]spelling[/color] in all in-character (IC) communication to the best of your ability.
- Avoid using [color=red]contemporary internet slang[/color], abbreviations (e.g., "brb," "pls," "tf"), or text emojis (e.g., ":D," ":)") in IC chat. While some common slang and abbreviations may be automatically converted to proper words, not all are coveredâ€”so always strive to use proper language yourself.
- Strive for [color=green]clarity[/color] and [color=green]immersion[/color] in your IC writing.
