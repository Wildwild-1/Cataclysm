  A Protogen is a technologically enhanced being made of both technological and biological parts. Though they have a mix of artificial and non-artificial organs, they still operate with a soul and mind, yet there are also program files that operate them, and overheating/overcooling can damage the circuits of the artificial organs. They still need to eat and be healed using normal medicines.

  They are capable of playing digital music innately and suffer less damage from lacking air.

  Their durable bodies makes them take 20% less Blunt damage, 10% less Piercing/Slash damage, but their hybrid electronic nature makes them take 30% more heat, 30% more cold, 50% more shock and 55% more radiation damage.
